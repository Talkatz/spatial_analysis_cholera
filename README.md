# spatial_analysis_cholera

In 1854 in London there was a severe outbreak of Cholera. The English physician Jon Snow, which 
is considered to be one of the founders of modern epidemiology, solved the problem by finding the source 
of the cholera, which was an infected water pump.

He mapped the cluster of the cholera cases, and the pump was in the middle of these cases.
He also tried to understand the relationship between the water and the cholera, which wasn't known
at that time. To find out more about him you can check the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow#Cholera

In this project I'll try to do what Snow did, but with code and some extra spatial analysis methods.
More methods will be added with time. 

The data is not from London, and was made by me with random coordinates from the city I grew up at, in Israel. 
This city is called Rishon LeZion, and of course there were never cholera cases in it :)
The data is in two csv files which are imported by the code, and they were also added to the project here.
